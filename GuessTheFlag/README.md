# Guess the Flag for iOS 🌍

Guess the Flag is a simple iOS game made using SwiftUI framework. It's the second project created when learning with the Hacking with Swift website. Game stores flags of 11 countries. Three of them are presented to the user in a randomized order.
Point of the game is to guess which flag belongs to the country the game asks for. The user is notified about his results and his score is counted. Interface is not 
very pretty, but it was never the point of this app. 🙄
