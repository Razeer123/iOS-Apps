# Bill Companion for iOS 💸

Bill Companion is a very simple iOS app made using SwiftUI framework. It's the first project created when learning with the Hacking with Swift website.
The goal of the app is to help the user split the bill when visiting a restaurant - it asks for the total price, number of people and optional tip and
displays cost of the visit calculated for each person.

# Implementation 👨‍💻

- Text input was created using TextField control
- Number of people and tip can be set by two different Picker controls (choosing this number could be easier with the TextField but it's just to show different Pickers)
