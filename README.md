# My iOS Apps 📱

This repository stores all iOS apps that I've written at the beginning of my journey with Swift and SwiftUI framework. Every folder here is a whole different
project which was either fully created by myself or came from Hacking with Swift website. It's explicitly states which app was written from beginning to the end by me. Each project tries to show different module (or combination of modules) from SwiftUI framework in action. 

# Projects 👨‍💻

1. **WeSplit** - simple app that helps the user to add a tip and split the bill with friends.
2. **Unit Converter** - simple app that converts units. It supports 4 conversion types and 17 units. *<- Written entirely by me*
3. **GuessTheFlag** - game in which user tries to guess which one of the shown flags is correct.
4. **Rock Paper Scissors** - simple game that lets you train your brain by choosing right moves for the wanted outcome in the Rock Paper & Scissors game. *<- Written entirely by me*
