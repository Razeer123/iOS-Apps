# My iOS Apps 📱

This repository stores all iOS apps that I've written at the beginning of my journey with Swift and SwiftUI framework. Every folder here is a whole different
project which was either fully created by myself or came from Hacking with Swift website. It's explicitly states which app was written from beginning to the end by me. Each project tries to show different module (or combination of modules) from SwiftUI framework in action. 

# Projects 👨‍💻

From newest and most exciting to oldest.

1. **Practise Multiplication** - simple expense tracker. User can add and delete data, it's stored locally on the device as JSON, so when the app is relaunched it's still here.
2. **Practise Multiplication** - simple, multi-view app that lets you practise multiplication in a given range. Questions are generated on the run. *<- Written entirely by me*
3. **Word Scramble** - game in which the user has to create as many words as possible using letters from a word that was picked randomly. Game checks correctness of an input.
4. **Student Rescuer** - simple app powered by Machine Learning that helps to decide when one should go to sleep to wake up at a given time and rest for x hours after consuming y cups of coffee.
5. **Rock Paper Scissors** - simple game that lets you train your brain by choosing right moves for the wanted outcome in the Rock Paper & Scissors game. *<- Written entirely by me*
6. **GuessTheFlag** - game in which user tries to guess which one of the shown flags is correct.
7. **Unit Converter** - simple app that converts units. It supports 4 conversion types and 17 units. *<- Written entirely by me*
