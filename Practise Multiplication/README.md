# Practise Multiplication ✖️

Practise Multiplication is a simple, multi-view app made using SwiftUI framework. **This app was created entirely by me.** Its goal is very simple - user selects the
number and range of question and the app generates them. During the gameplay player is informed about his score and wheter the answer was correct or not. Everything
is decorated with some cool animations. Interface may not be very pretty but hey - it was never the point of this app!

Please bear in mind that this project will be updated in the future.
