# Unit Converter for iOS 🧮

Unit Converter is a simple iOS app made using SwiftUI framework. It was written entirely by me. Using the program is pretty straight-forward. After launching it,
user selects conversion type: right now Unit Converter can work with temperature, length, time and volume. At the moment there are 17 supported units. App works well
with floating numbers and displays the converted value with solid accuracy.
