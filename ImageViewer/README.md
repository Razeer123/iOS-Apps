# Image Viewer (Cocoa Touch)

Bill Companion is a very simple iOS app made using the Cocoa Touch library. It's the first project created when learning with the Hacking with Swift website. 
The interface of the app is basic - it displays a list of available images. The user can click on one to enter the viewing mode, where the image is presented 
on the full screen. The navigation bar can be hidden by tapping the screen.
